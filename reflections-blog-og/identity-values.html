      <h2>Ethical Decisions</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        A recent ethical decision I made was how I utilise my time and capacity,
        and the role I play within my community. I decided to reassess and
        disengage myself from certain environments. Doing this and
        re-prioritising my goals, was an incredibly hard decision to make. I
        felt a personal responsibility to use my skills to improve the spaces
        and communities I belonged to, particularly when it came to bringing
        people together, creating a productive and safe environment and making
        sure those who struggle to share or be heard, are heard. .

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        During a conference many years ago on environmental organising, the
        simple sentence “some need to take a step back, so others can take a
        step forward” had a massive impact on me. It reframed the way I saw my
        engagement as an assertive and social person. It made me rethink the
        ways in which empowerment, autonomy and active participation move within
        any group with a shared goal. It helps me slow down, hear and understand
        perspectives, so we can grow and build together. A much later
        realisation was that someone else can step into the role that I leave.

        Making the choice to withdraw my active participation in some spaces
        felt like I was betraying myself and my communities. As a queer wahine,
        It felt like I was giving up, being selfish and leaving people who
        needed me behind. It felt like I was choosing the individual over the
        collective, comfort over improvement, and participating in the problem,
        rather than the solution. I felt a lot of confusion over the right
        choice to make, however I also knew I needed to make some changes to
        move forward within a personal capacity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        I had to shift focus, put my own oxygen mask on first, and apply that
        focus to improving and finding balance in my own life. I learnt how to
        say no to the people and things that I loved, and maintain my
        boundaries, so I could discover and create the life I needed to move
        forward, so that I can better serve my whanau and communities in a
        sustainable way.

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        The way in which I was applying my personal ethics and capacity was
        unsustainable, and prevented me from being able to focus on my personal
        goals. Re-evaluating my capacity, having trust in others and finding new
        ways to live allowed me to make decisions about my own future. It was
        the right decision. I still help in the small capacity that I can, and I
        am excited to bring the same enthusiasm, with a deeper understanding of
        myself, to other areas of my life.

        My father would say “always stand up for the underdog” and “do what
        makes you happy” and I took both of these extremely seriously and
        applied it fully to my life. Primarily coming from Otepoti/Dunedin, from
        a big bougie bogan family, we often had different experiences and
        understandings of the world and the problems within it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        We spent our working in the family businesses, playing in nature, and
        spent a lot of time in heated debate. Nothing was off the table to be
        discussed, however it was often in a very disrespectful manner, and very
        in line with colonial thinking. This taught me de-escalation and how
        complicated interpersonal relationships can be, and the role in which I
        play in them. It also fostered a strong understanding of what I want,
        and practice, in my own communities and relationships.

        This was very different to the time I spent with my mother, whom I had
        lived with on and off in England and Tauranga. She existed in a very
        different space and experience of this world, one that I have always
        felt I needed to defend and protect. She did not have the same support
        and opportunities that I have received in my life. I have always been
        shocked at the way she was treated or dismissed in so many different
        environments. Having this juxtaposition within my up-bringing, flying
        back and forth between them, and trying my best to make sure my siblings
        were safe and comfortable, explains a lot about who I am and the values
        I hold. For me, home has always been the people I love.

        I found my results from allright.org.nz's Strengths Finder interesting
        as I feel like my behaviour is very contextual to the specific
        situation. It was difficult to feel like it covered the nuance of being
        a human into today’s world. My Extraversion and Openness to Experience
        both ranked high. These traits have always been a strong part of my
        identity and experience. I always find it interesting when I don’t
        behave this way, as I then can check what is causing me anxiety, or if
        there is a misalignment in my life that is causing me to retreat. Like
        all things in life, we are always changing and growing. Having more
        self-control over these aspects of myself has helped me find more
        balance. I am forever grateful that I am who I am, and that I exist in
        the way that I do. It allows me to meet people, make connections and
        learn from interactions constantly. It brings me joy every single day.
        It has helped me overcome many barriers in my life and has always given
        me hope about a better future for us all.

        The Neuroticism traits were interesting to me. I was surprised my
        anxiety and self-consciousness was low, as I feel anxiety in settings
        where I’m unsure how my enthusiasm and energy will be received, or if I
        am potentially in danger of being put in an uncomfortable or unsafe
        situation. When I share my anxieties or reflections, people who don’t
        know me well are shocked that I feel that way. I see how it can be at
        odds with how I present, as I am often seen as extremely confident and
        secure. This is another reason that I strongly value making sure people
        feel safe, and heard. I feel anger when people are malicious or bully
        others, for life is hard enough and healing can only come from love.

      <p>
        I was also surprised that agreeableness was so high. I strive for
        balance and fairness, for all. However, I do not consider myself someone
        who would betray myself, for the comfort, or unaccountability, of one
        over the collective. Individual needs must be met, but not cause harm to
        others. I am not modest as a person, but I am open about my mistakes and
        weaknesses. Which I consider a strength. I try to be tactful, but I
        believe self-compassion and appreciation is important. A good friend of
        mine once said “She always thinks she is amazing, but she also thinks
        everyone else in the room is, too”, and I thought that was a beautiful
        way to describe it. I find it really hard to be modest, for life isn’t
        easy and I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for the steps I’ve taken,
        work I’ve done and the support and love I’ve received from the people in
        my life, and I love to celebrate that.

        I strive for balance but I also love to treat myself in whatever
        capacity I can. Due to my dopamine chasing nature, I’ve set many
        boundaries and limitations around what, how and why I engage with
        situations and hobbies. I love a good chat, and will talk to anyone, so
        things like headphones, actively opening with the prelude that I have
        something else to do/or have to go, and tactfully seizing the energy to
        leave as soon as it hits helps.

        I try to have compassion for myself when I lose something or make a bad
        call with time-management, or feel anxiety over how something was
        interpreted. I try to keep the frustration or sadness fleeting. Looking
        at nature, the people I love, or something colourful always helps. In
        these moments, I try to remember that I am just an animal on this earth
        trying to survive under a system that is not built for everyone. I use
        calendars, alarms, notes, routines and my whare is very specific in its
        functionality so that my ADHD traits don’t bring too much chaos.
        Time-blindness and high emotion are two things that I have to keep in
        check every single day. I tend to feel deeply, and luckily it’s usually
        joy. You can’t ignore your feelings, only manage them. Receiving my ADHD
        diagnosis, medication and therapy have greatly helped me.

        I have a range of ways to self soothe, communicate and breathe. I
        appreciate that my high energy translates into a lot of unintentional
        healthy behaviours and habits, as long as I keep coaxing them in that
        direction. I would have loved to have had that support as a child and
        young adult. I have always worked hard to prove myself, achieved most of
        my goals and have, and had, the most incredible friends. I have always
        been extremely grateful for my chosen whanau, however It wasn’t until I
        actively separated myself and had the blessing of being able to live
        alone for a while, that I realised how much we had learnt from each
        other and how much I depended on them. Community holds each other up
        when the system fails. Community is the system that matters to me the
        most. I would not be as capable as I am, if it wasn’t for their
        unwavering love and support. Making the choice to take a step back,
        allowed me to build the systems I need to thrive independently, so I can
        sustainably participate within the group.

      <h2>Strategies Around Productive Collaberation</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        Conflict resolution is a skill I've spent my whole life refining, coming
        from a large family who worked and lived together throughout my early
        youth, and from many of my mahi choices.

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        A recent example was when we had a big change in our shared working
        space, with a new collaborator who had very different values and work
        ethic to the rest of our space. The traditional channels that were set
        up, such as direct feedback and meetings to discuss issues, were
        unproductive, with no change or if so, little adherence to it. This
        caused a lot of disruption and made it very difficult for some to
        participate. We decided to create a workers collective, so that we could
        clearly and effectively all work together and prevent further
        disentanglement and alienation.

    </div>

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        During these meetings, I was struggling with not deviating from the
        agenda and debating with a specific person. We agreed on the problems,
        but had very different ideas about appropriate solutions. It would get
        very cyclical, with neither of us really hearing each other, and
        although we had the passion for it, it was unproductive and noticeably
        interrupting the flow and time constraints we had, as well as being
        tiresome for those who would have to wait for us to get our points
        across. When I clocked the cycle we were in, and that we weren’t going
        to be able to move forward or make a decision, as well as causing
        discomfort to the rest of our peers, we tried multiple actions,
        including:

      <ul style="list-style: circle; color: #e4f9fa">

          Putting a pin in it to return to later when it was appropriate, or
          more relevant. This was helpful for the agenda, however sometimes
          meant the issue was lost.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reiterating our goals and needs prior to engagement, this helped
          everyone be more present and mindful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Us both discussing particulars outside of meetings, particularly
          before meetings, so that we had the space to hear and learn from each
          other, without it stagnating the goals of our collective. This was
          effective but time consuming, and had a wonderful impact on our
          interpersonal relationship.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also shifted back to the collective space, as we’d been hosting in
          our homes and third places, and found it kept us more focused and
          structured. The behaviours and issues we were experiencing were at
          odds with the very well defined kaupapa we shared within that space,
          and this was very helpful.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent" style="padding: 1em; margin: 1em">
      <p>
        The thing I found most interesting was we were both incredibly invested
        and passionate, very much on the same team, however had different ideas
        of the stakeholders, resources and effective strategy. The group would
        comment that we would both be saying the same thing, however in
        different ways, which made witnessing these interactions even more
        frustrating for them. This was helpful, as it was clearly a blindspot
        for us both. We started to focus on clarifying questions and
        understanding the message when the other was talking. We would
        acknowledge we were activated, self-regulate, and then return if we
        noticed ourselves slipping back into that pattern. Transparency and
        accountability was strong throughout this process, as we all know that
        strength is found in the collective, and that took priority over our
        egos. We also had a lot of respect for each other, and had very
        important roles to play within the collective. I learnt so much from her
        and from the mahi we put in to be able to collaborate. Both
        theoretically, and how to apply de-escalation and compassion to myself
        and others, even when I feel frustration and such high stakes. If I had
        the chance to try other strategies, it would have been to identify what
        I can control and not let transference of previous experiences feed into
        the present, activating defensiveness within myself.
