      <p>
        My long term goals and career pathway are very much in line with my
        personal values.

        I have a few ideas of how I want to apply the skills I learn in programming. Other than being handy in an apocalypse, I want to be able to help make essential applications and databases accessible and effective. As more things move online, we need to make sure they are user-friendly, especially when they relate to medical, governmental and services necessary for daily living. I will wait on call for however long it takes, if I find the app or webpage hard to navigate. This requires both time, patience and people skills, as in most cases, they will try to coax you back to the site, as human resources are often limited. I have a lot of concern for those who need these services and don’t have the resources and skills needed to access the information and support. As one of these people, I want to be able to navigate and help make these necessary applications effective and efficient for everyone involved. 

      </p> </div>
      <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
     
      <P>I have always actively chosen to work in spaces that align with my values, and I would want to work in environments that share these values. People and the environment come first, and I want to participate in places that reflect that, or in which I can influence in that direction. 
        I’m looking forward to learning, committing and practising better ways of living, and self-regulating, so I can be in a position to reach my own goals, and be able to help others reach theirs. 
        </P>

    <div class="intro">
      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>Appreciation, kindness and curiosity. I’m happy that these strengths have helped me make some connections in foundations, and I’m looking forward to continuing that in bootcamp. I like getting to know people and working together towards a goal. I feel so much joy in this. Wanting to help others has helped me learn new things, and reaching out for help has helped me feel more comfortable and reassured I’m on the right path. The celebration when something works, or when I’ve figured something out, is tremendous. I need to learn how to manage the journey it takes to get there. Accept and celebrate the struggle, so I can keep growing in the direction I want to. I have a lot of appreciation for how I’ve handled some challenges at home for realignment, and how all things considered, I'm adapting at a pace that makes sense for me. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p> As Foundations has gone on, I can see my struggles with fueling my body and resting effectively, impacts my learning and ability to engage. Seeing these as non-negotiables, rather than ignoring them,  allows me to actually do the work I need to do. Some lessons we have to learn again and again, and I’m happy that I was able to be swiftly reminded of this reality and make some changes.  I love a good chat, and will talk to anyone, so things like headphones, actively opening with the prelude that I have something else to do/or have to go, and tactfully seizing the energy to leave as soon as it hits helps. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>All in all, the little things add up and I feel like I'm living a healthy life, and I am proud of all the steps I've taken to find stability within myself. Medication, balance of schedule, planning and whanau support help me with these things. Managing my medication and its impact on my appetite and sleep,  and planning still need work, however I’m slowly figuring out what works for this new lifestyle. </p>

    <div class="intro">
      <h2>Bootcamp Challenges</h2>
    
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>Emotional self-regulation (aka not crying when overwhelmed), and practising mindfulness is an ongoing journey for me. Making sure I have a balance of caring for myself, so that I'm able to work through the technical issues, and have my brain play along. 
        Staying on top of the material is also a concern, as I don't want to make things harder for others when pair programming by not having a confident grasp of the content. I have a plan to go back through the tech sprints, with wellness in mind, so I can absorb and learn things that I've missed or don’t feel like I have a confident grasp of. I’m confident that I will feel differently when bootcamp starts. If not, then I will make sure I'm being open about where I’m at, while not catastrophising the situation. I am here to learn, and I am certainly learning!

      <h2>Non-Technical Skill Development</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
     <p>
      Practising wellness and clear communication are the things that stand out to me the most. I always thought I was quite good at communicating, however when I am panicked or overwhelmed that is certainly not the case. Being able to slow down, be mindful and clearly communicate my questions/problems in a way that is concise will be greatly beneficial. Focusing and communicating the details, rather than a hazy bigger picture without context. Patience comes up every day for me, in regards to myself and to my work.

      <h2>Commitments</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>My commitment to myself and others, is following through on set timeframes and being compassionate to myself and others. A commitment to transparency and accountability through clear and consistent communication and self-reflection. To catch myself when I feel activated, and self-regulate so that my engagement is productive and efficient. I will try to keep my focus on the task. If I feel uncomfortable about something that is said or happens I will use the  conflict de-escalation skills I have learnt over the years, or talk to a human skills facilitator for advice. 
        I will ask for help if I have spent more than 1hr trying to personally problem solve, and have exhausted my own personal steps. If I feel like I am spiralling/overwhelmed, I will ask myself what I think the underlying concern is and practise the self-care I need to balance myself.

It has helped me to feel safe to participate in the online platform asking for help and sharing my blog posts that make me feel vulnerable. </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>My strengths and limitations in learning seem very in line with my personal life choices and my ADHD. Although I appreciate the “ADHD is a superpower” sentiment, I think it can negate the very real daily struggle I face with managing energy, focus and nutrition. I must keep these in balance, or I feel dysregulated and it is a lot harder to achieve my goals.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>Appreciation, kindness and curiosity are my biggest strengths. These translate into enthusiastic and compassionate engagement. Love, expressed through appreciation and kindness, brings me joy and allows me to connect with people. Having an awareness of autonomy, and compassion for the struggle, lifts and connects us all. Curiosity, of how things and people work, and why they are that way, has always been a great strength. I love asking questions, to make sure I understand, and also to learn more. We all have blindspots, and I love meeting people with different skills and perspectives, so we can learn and grow together, making our world more inclusive for all. Being extraverted and open to new experiences allows me to be bold and learn new things, while also bringing others together and sharing an enthusiastic energy. This can be very contagious, and has been a blessing my whole life. I have been able to build community wherever I decide to go, and this helps me truly value the choices I make, and the risks that I take.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>Humility, self-Regulation and disruptive ADHD symptoms are my biggest challenges. I strive for balance but I also love to treat myself in whatever capacity I can. Due to my dopamine chasing nature, I’ve set many boundaries and limitations around what, how and why I engage with situations and hobbies. I love a good chat, and will talk to anyone, so things like headphones, actively opening with the prelude that I have something else to do/or have to go, and tactfully seizing the energy to leave as soon as it hits helps.

    </div>
    <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      <p>I try to have compassion for myself when I lose something or make a bad call with time-management, or feel anxiety over how something was interpreted.  I try to keep the frustration or sadness fleeting. Looking at nature, the people I love, or something colourful always helps. In these moments, I try to remember that I am just an animal on this earth trying to survive under a system that is not built for everyone. I use calendars, alarms, notes, routines and my whare is very specific in its functionality so that my ADHD traits don’t bring too much chaos. Time-blindness and high emotion are two things that I have to keep in check every single day. I tend to feel deeply, and luckily it’s usually joy. You can’t ignore your feelings, only manage them. Receiving my ADHD diagnosis, medication and therapy have greatly helped me. I have a range of ways to self soothe, communicate and breathe. I appreciate that my high energy translates into a lot of unintentional healthy behaviors and habits, as long as I keep coaxing them in that direction.

    <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      <p>
        I have never really worked in a traditional office space, or in places where the values weren’t a centric part of the kaupapa. Being able to work as a team online, rather than in person, is a challenge for me. I have been very specific in the last few years about finding balance, play and rest. It’s been quite a shock coming back to 40 hr weeks, and prioritsing it over doing whatever I want, whenever I want . The internal work, and life balance, was my main priority for so long, and I was extremely lucky to be able to have that time. However, accepting that challenge provides growth and that I am actively fighting against, and rebuilding, my wiring, is comforting. I am excited to see an improvement in these areas, and feel less out of touch with the traditional working world.
