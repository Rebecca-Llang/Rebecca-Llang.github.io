      <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>
        My long term goals and career pathway are very much in line with my
        personal values.
      </p>

      <div class="homeContent">

        I have a few ideas of how I want to apply the skills I learn in
        programming. Other than being handy in an apocalypse, I want to be able
        to help make essential applications and databases accessible and
        effective. As more things move online, we need to make sure they are
        user-friendly, especially when they relate to medical, governmental and
        services necessary for daily living. I will wait on call for however
        long it takes, if I find the app or webpage hard to navigate. This
        requires both time, patience and people skills, as in most cases, they
        will try to coax you back to the site, as human resources are often
        limited. I don’t consider myself to be too tech illiterate, so I have a
        lot of concern for those who need these services and don’t have the
        resources and skills needed to access the information and support.

        I have always actively chosen to work in spaces that align with my
        values, and I would want to work in environments that share these
        values. People and the environment come first, and I want to participate
        in places that reflect that, or in which I can influence in that
        direction.

      <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>My strengths and limitations in learning seem very in line with my personal life choices and my ADHD. Although I appreciate the “ADHD is a superpower” sentiment, I think it can negate the very real daily struggle I face with managing energy, focus and nutrition. I must keep these in balance, or I feel dysregulated and it is a lot harder to achieve my goals.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>Appreciation, kindness and curiosity are my biggest strengths. These translate into enthusiastic and compassionate engagement. Love, expressed through appreciation and kindness, brings me joy and allows me to connect with people. Having an awareness of autonomy, and compassion for the struggle, lifts and connects us all. Curiosity, of how things and people work, and why they are that way, has always been a great strength. I love asking questions, to make sure I understand, and also to learn more. We all have blindspots, and I love meeting people with different skills and perspectives, so we can learn and grow together, making our world more inclusive for all. Being extraverted and open to new experiences allows me to be bold and learn new things, while also bringing others together and sharing an enthusiastic energy. This can be very contagious, and has been a blessing my whole life. I have been able to build community wherever I decide to go, and this helps me truly value the choices I make, and the risks that I take.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>Humility, self-Regulation and disruptive ADHD symptoms are my biggest challenges. I strive for balance but I also love to treat myself in whatever capacity I can. Due to my dopamine chasing nature, I’ve set many boundaries and limitations around what, how and why I engage with situations and hobbies. I love a good chat, and will talk to anyone, so things like headphones, actively opening with the prelude that I have something else to do/or have to go, and tactfully seizing the energy to leave as soon as it hits helps. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>All in all, the little things add up and I feel like I'm living a healthy life, and I am proud of all the steps I've taken to find stability within myself. Medication, balance of schedule, planning and whanau support help me with these things. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      <p>I try to have compassion for myself when I lose something or make a bad call with time-management, or feel anxiety over how something was interpreted.  I try to keep the frustration or sadness fleeting. Looking at nature, the people I love, or something colourful always helps. In these moments, I try to remember that I am just an animal on this earth trying to survive under a system that is not built for everyone. I use calendars, alarms, notes, routines and my whare is very specific in its functionality so that my ADHD traits don’t bring too much chaos. Time-blindness and high emotion are two things that I have to keep in check every single day. I tend to feel deeply, and luckily it’s usually joy. You can’t ignore your feelings, only manage them. Receiving my ADHD diagnosis, medication and therapy have greatly helped me. I have a range of ways to self soothe, communicate and breathe. I appreciate that my high energy translates into a lot of unintentional healthy behaviors and habits, as long as I keep coaxing them in that direction.

      <h2>Non-Technical Skill Development</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
      <p>
        I have never really worked in a traditional office space, or in places where the values weren’t a centric part of the kaupapa. Being able to work as a team online, rather than in person, is a challenge for me. I have been very specific in the last few years about finding balance, play and rest. It’s been quite a shock coming back to 40 hr weeks, and prioritsing it over doing whatever I want, whenever I want . The internal work, and life balance, was my main priority for so long, and I was extremely lucky to be able to have that time. However, accepting that challenge provides growth and that I am actively fighting against, and rebuilding, my wiring, is comforting. I am excited to see an improvement in these areas, and feel less out of touch with the traditional working world.

      <h2>Commitments</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent">
      <p>My commitment to myself and others, is following through on set timeframes and being compassionate to myself and others. A commitment to transparency and accountability through clear and consistent communication and self-reflection. To catch myself when I feel activated, and self-regulate so that my engagement is productive and efficient. I will try to keep my focus professional, and not overstep boundaries around appropriate conversations. Although the personal is political, I don’t want to alienate myself, and cause distraction and defensiveness in others. If I must engage, I will do so using the conflict de-escalation skills I have learnt over the years. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
      <p>I will ask for help if I have spent more than 30 mins trying to personally problem solve, and have exhausted my own personal steps. If I feel like I am spiraling, I will ask myself what I think the underlying concern is and practice the self-care I need to balance myself.

      <h2>Expectations from the Facilitators</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="homeContent" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
    <p>Compassion and kindness, that I am trying my best and I’m not actively trying to make things harder for myself. Clear, constructive feedback. Reassurance that I’m on the right track, and suggestions of what habits might cause me havoc in the long run. I’ve really enjoyed the energy of the three facilitators I've spoken to. It has helped me to feel safe to participate in the online platform asking for help and sharing my blog posts that  make me feel vulnerable.</p>
