        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The role my ego plays in my self-esteem and how it can block me from
          fully absorbing and internalising content. I tried to speed through
          things, and then would have big blocks that I would struggle to
          overcome because of a lack of patience for the process and compassion
          for my struggles. This would then impact my confidence, as I'd set
          such high expectations for myself, rather than accepting the content
          and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          That prioritising myself meant actively working through
          responsibilities and expectations at home, and making plans and
          options so that we can tackle new challenges both together and
          separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          I struggled asking for help a lot more than I thought I would, with
          feelings of being a burden or annoying, for struggling with the same
          things over and over. Accepting and letting go of these feelings of
          shame and being unable, so I could move forward and learn (ie not
          yet/growth mindset) took some time. I can see how my ego can really
          get in the way of me engaging and participating, and the anxiety
          around me not understanding something is so intense. I’ve been working
          through it and really trying to ask for what I need before I feel like
          I'm in a crisis.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          I felt really well versed when it came to how I treated and engaged
          with others, and it really highlighted how much I needed to apply that
          to my relationship with myself more consistently. I thought that over
          the last few years I had really learnt the skills that allowed me to
          look after myself, however I’ve seen that I used them by making my
          life smaller, and now I’m learning how to adapt them to fit in with
          new challenges. I really liked the habits and building behaviour
          models, and can see why I can slip as I often try to do everything at
          once. Celebrating the wins, like having a consistent bed-time and
          rising routine and bringing back yoga and alone time. Reminding myself
          that I’m in a time of big change, both with Devs and moving into a new
          place with my partner, and that I know what my biggest struggles are,
          and I know ways in which I can work to improve them.

        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          For me, it was being honest and vulnerable while trying to decide the
          limitations that I was comfortable with. I did find it confronting, as
          stigma and discrimination does exist, and I didn’t quite know how to
          navigate it honestly, while also protecting my privacy and boundaries.
          Luckily, I cried about it in an open co-working space with a
          facilitator (not clicking it was public), which another student
          accidentally was in, so it was the fear itself being realised. This
          made me laugh, and took a lot of pressure off, as I’d already done the
          thing I was worried about and everything was fine.

      <h2>Why Humans Skills in programming?</h2>
      <div class="block2bebes">
        <p>
          It’s important in all aspects of life. People, and individuals, all
          matter and the world is a better place with diversity, compassion and
          connection. The mental health of the individual, and the collective,
          strengthens and lifts us all, and the impact will make the community a
          safer and happier place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had some moments thinking I would speed through Human Skills as I
          consider it to be one of my strengths. However through the journey,
          and the very obvious lack of compassion, patience and acceptance of my
          struggles shows how much I still have to go. I did find it quite
          upsetting at the start, as I felt it was hard to establish the
          boundaries of what I wanted and didn’t want to share, however it
          really pushed me to make some necessary adjustments and have some very
          frank and honest conversations in my new living space and dynamic. I
          can see where I have work to do, and I think it’ll be so incredibly
          helpful for me to adapt into spaces that don’t have such a strong
          focus on human skills, as I will be stronger in self-regulating, and
          letting things go.
