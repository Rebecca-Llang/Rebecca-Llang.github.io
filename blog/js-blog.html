        <p>
          HTML is the skeleton of your webpage. It provides the basic structure,
          like headers, text, images, and links. Think of HTML as the backbone
          and the various elements as the limbs that extend and interact with
          the CSS and JS. Without HTML, the website would lack structure and
          content.
        </p>
        <p >
          CSS is the aesthetics of your webpage. CSS is responsible for how
          everything looks and is positioned on the screen. Imagine CSS as the
          clothing and style that make the HTML look appealing. It tells the web
          browser how to display HTML elements, controls things like colors,
          fonts, and layouts. CSS brings beauty and elegance to the structured
          skeleton framework provided by HTML. It is the interior decorator of
          the web.
        </p>
        <p >
          JavaScript is the brain, dictating action or behavior of your webpage.
          JS makes your website interactive and responsive to user actions. For
          example, JavaScript can handle what happens when you click a button,
          type in a form, or upload a file. It's like the brain of the
          operation, directing actions and making decisions to enhance user
          experience.

        <p>
          JavaScript allows us to change and edit the content and style of our
          webpage, alongside HTML and CSS. JS often uses objects, functions and
          loops to make what you want to happen, happen. It references classes
          and ID’s to interact directly with what it needs to. Classes are often
          used for CSS, and ID’s for HTML elements. JS allows us to build
          complex, dynamic projects. This allows us to nest, build and offer
          many options and next steps when interacted with by the user, as well
          as a way to edit our DOM quickly in the future.

        <h3>CONTROL FLOW & LOOPS</h3>

    </div>
    <!-- INTRO CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS-->
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        JavaScript’s control flow is built by using statements and functions
        such as if/else and switch statements, loops and function calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        If statements, will check if a parameter is met, and depending on if it
        is true, do a certain function. You can use if/else statements to
        provide other options of what to do if the initial parameters are false.
        Switch statements use a similar system, however the syntax is different
        and provides a ‘case’ of each option of the action in reference to the
        outcome of conditions of the parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loops allow us to engage with arrays and objects repeatedly, using
        iteration. Parameters set the initial value of the iteration, how many
        times to iterate through the object/array and what to do after the
        initial loop.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- WHEN TO USE CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS--> 

    <div class="whyWhenHow">
      <div class="when">
        <p>
          Use an If statement if you want to perform a certain action if the
          parameters are met. Use if/else to provide other actions under
          different conditions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="when">
        <p>
          Use loops to repeat tasks, iterate over arrays and objects, do
          something until certain conditions are met, to do calculations and
          manipulate or search data.

      <p>
        Arrays are containers that hold a collection of elements with the same
        type of data. Arrays start their element position at 0. An array could
        have a .length of ‘4’, which would be placed as [0,1,2,3] within the
        array. We can access elements in the array using their position in the
        index. They are used when you want to group similar items, such as
        names, products or numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are containers that are used to group multiple different sets of
        related data. Each set of data is given in pairs, with a key and a
        value. They are used for things like individual people’s information,
        and as a reference for functions and different sections of your DOM.
        They can also allow us to access properties such as other objects and
        functions.

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        A function is an object that holds a method to do something. As objects,
        they help us to organise, and reuse code, in sections that make sense
        for the task. Functions are like recipes, there is the name, the steps
        and the final result.

        <p>
          Element Nodes: Each HTML tag (such as 'div' or 'p') becomes an element
          node. These nodes are children of the root node or other element
          nodes.

        <p>
          Text Nodes: Text within elements (like within the 'p' tag) are

          Attribute Nodes: Attributes of HTML tags (#id, .class) are also nodes
          associated with their respective elements. Classes can be applied
