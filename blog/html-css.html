      <h1>CSS Positioning Styles</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        We live in a beautiful world, and we have a tendency to like order and
        aesthetics. Positioning in CSS allows us to create this order and beauty
        on a webpage. It is the online version of a design layout, like the
        layout of articles and images in a magazine.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        When we position content intentionally, it allows for us and our devices
        to engage with web pages in a functional and adaptable way. Without it,
        content would be hidden, and accessibility greatly reduced, as certain
        devices and human limitations would not be able to clearly see and read
        the information. Imagine if every webpage had a font so large that only
        a few words could fit on the screen. Positioning helps us make sure the
        font can adapt, so all the text can be read.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, positioning is used to keep certain content contained in neat,
        set sections. We call these sections “containers”. Inside this, we can
        put content like images and text, called “elements”.

    <div class="homeContent">
      <h2>Positioning can be done in 3 main ways:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Small tweeks:</p>
          Adjusting its position relative to its normal place, known as relative
          positioning
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Glued to the container:</p>
          Aligning it exactly where you want it within its parent container,
          known as absolute positioning
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fixed on the screen:</p>
          Setting an element in a fixed place on the viewport/screen, known as
          fixed positioning
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="relativePos">
      <h3></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="absolutePos">
      <h3></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="fixedPos">
      <h3></h3>
    </div>
