      <h1>CSS Positioning Styles</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        We live in a beautiful world, and we have a tendency to like order and
        aesthetics. Positioning in CSS allows us to create this order and beauty
        on a webpage. It is the online version of a design layout, like the
        layout of articles and images in a magazine.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        When we position content intentionally, it allows for us and our devices
        to engage with web pages in a functional and adaptable way. Without it,
        content would be hidden, and accessibility greatly reduced, as certain
        devices and human limitations would not be able to clearly see and read
        the information. Imagine if every webpage had a font so large that only
        a few words could fit on the screen. Positioning helps us make sure the
        font can adapt, so all the text can be read.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, positioning is used to keep certain content contained in neat,
        set sections. We call these sections “containers”. Inside this, we can
        put content like images and text, called “elements”.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent">
      <h2 style="align-content: center">
        Positioning can be done in three main ways :
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Relative Positioning: Small tweeks</p>
          Adjusting its position relative to its normal place
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Absolute Positioning: Glued to the container</p>
          Aligning it exactly where you want it within its parent container
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fixed Positioning: Fixed on the screen</p>
          Setting an element in a fixed place on the viewport/screen
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div><!-- include an image here --></div>
    

    <div class="header" style="margin-top:1em"><h3>Relative Positioning</h3></div>
    

    <div class="whyWhenHow">
      <!-- having issues making these even, will return-->
      <div class="when">
        <ul><h3>Why:</h3>
          <li>It lets you to slightly move an element from its normal position, without affecting other parts of the page.
          <li>It can set up a reference point for elements that are positioned absolutely</li>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="when">
        <ul><h3>When:</h3>
          <li>When you want to slightly move an element (left, right, up or down) without disturbing the rest of your webpage.</li>
          <li>
            As a Parent container for child elements with absolute positioning.</li>
          
        </ul> 
    </div>
    </div>
    
      <div class="def relativePos">
      <h2>position: relative;</h2>
      <p>
        An element with <span id="highlight">position: relative;</span> is set
        in relation to its own default position, and that of its parent
        container within the webpage flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means we created a section (parent container) and inside this we
        created an item. This item (element) , like text or an image, is set to
        behave and adjust itself, in relation to itself, and to the section it
        belongs to.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let’s say we have a section on the web page called
        <span id="highlight">‘.homeContent’</span> Inside this section, you have
        two smaller areas, one for links, and one for an image. Both are set to
        <span id="highlight">‘position: relative’</span>. This means they will
        stay in their usual place but can be shifted slightly without disturbing
        the overall flow and layout. It also means the elements will adjust
        alongside the parent container as it adjusts to different screen types
        and platforms.
      </p>

    <div class="how">
      <ol><h3>How to use Relative Positioning</h3>
        <li>Choose the element you want to adjust.</li>
        <li>Apply <span id="highlight">position: relative</span> : this style sets relative position to the selected element.</li>
        <li>Adjust and slightly move the element using properties such as <span id="highlight">top, right, bottom and left</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div> 

    <div class="header" style="margin-top:1em"><h3>Absolute Positioning</h3></div>
   <div class="whyWhenHow">
        <div class="when">
          <ul><h3>Why:</h3>
            <li>To place an element exactly where you want to within its parent container</li>
            <li>It’s useful for overlapping or layering contents and containers on a page</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
        <div class="when"> 
          <ul><h3>When:</h3>
            <li>You want an element to stay in a specific spot within its parent container.
            </li>
            <li>For Floating elements like tooltips, pop-ups, or icons that need to appear in a specific spot.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
   </div>
    
    <div class="def absolutePos">
      <h2>position: absolute;</h2>
      <p>
        An element with <span id="highlight">position: absolute;</span>, sits in
        relation to its parent container, exactly where you want it to. Think
        back to the metaphor of the tree. The webpage is the trunk, with
        containers and elements being branches and leaves. Absolute positioning
        allows you to glue a leaf exactly where you want to on a branch
        (parent), regardless of how the branch moves. This means we can place
        elements exactly where we like them in a section, and keep them there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s use Tooltips as an example. Say you are writing a blog post and
        you want a Tooltip to appear when a certain word is hovered over. You
        can use absolute positioning to make sure the tooltip hovers over the
        correct word, regardless of how the page content shifts. You could
        create a container called <span id="highlight">.toolTip</span> and set
        it to <span id="highlight">position: relative;</span>. Inside this, you
        have a child element called
        <span id="highlight">.toolTipText</span> with
        <span id="highlight">position: absolute;</span>. This setup ensures that
        the tooltip text always appears in the right spot relative to the word
      </p>
    </div>
          
    <div class="how">
    <ol><h3>How to use Absolute Positioning</h3>
      <li>Set the parent container to <span id="highlight">position: relative;</span> : this makes sure the child element will be positioned in relation to the parent.</li>
      <li>Select which child element you want to position absolutely.</li>
      <li>Set <span id="highlight">position: absolute;</span> to fix the position of the element within the parent.</li>
      <li>Use <span id="highlight">top, right, bottom, left</span> to specify the exact position of that element within its parent container. </li>
      
    </ol>
  </div>

    <div class="header" style="margin-top:1em"><h3>Fixed Positioning</h3></div>
      
      <div class="whyWhenHow">
        <div class="when">
          <ul><h3>Why:</h3>
            <li>For elements that need to stay in a fixed spot in view while the user scrolls.
            </li>
            <li>It keeps important features, such as navigation bars or buttons, in place for easy access.
            </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
        <div class="when"> 
          <ul><h3>When:</h3>
            <li>For navigation and important content to stay in view as the user scrolls, such as sticky headers and footers.

            </li>
            <li>Floating navigation or help buttons that must stay in a fixed spot.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="def fixedPos">
      <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
      <p>
        An element with <span id="highlight">position: fixed;</span> will stay
        anchored in place on the viewport (the screen), regardless of where you
        scroll. This is useful for things that you want to remain visible at all
        times on the screen. It is like super gluing a picture of your cat on
        top of your screen, so you can always see its lovely little face.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can often see this used for navigation and branding purposes. They
        can help users move through the page and links, remember where they are,
        and return to where they want to go. These are access and orientation
        prompts that help users interact effectively with the webpage.
      </p>

        <li>Choose which element you want fixed on the screen.</li>
        <li>Set <span id="highlight">position: fixed; </span>within this element to fix it into place relative to the viewport</li>
        <li>Use <span id="highlight">top, right, bottom, left </span>to define the element’s position on the screen (viewport)</li>
