      <h1>CSS Positioning Styles</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        We live in a beautiful world, and we have a tendency to like order and
        aesthetics. Positioning in CSS allows us to create this order and beauty
        on a webpage. It is the online version of a design layout, like the
        layout of articles and images in a magazine.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        When we position content intentionally, it allows for us and our devices
        to engage with web pages in a functional and adaptable way. Without it,
        content would be hidden, and accessibility greatly reduced, as certain
        devices and human limitations would not be able to clearly see and read
        the information. Imagine if every webpage had a font so large that only
        a few words could fit on the screen. Positioning helps us make sure the
        font can adapt, so all the text can be read.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, positioning is used to keep certain content contained in neat,
        set sections. We call these sections “containers”. Inside this, we can
        put content like images and text, called “elements”.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="homeContent">
      <h2 style="align-content: center">
        Positioning can be done in three main ways :
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Small tweeks: Relative Positioning</p>
          Adjusting its position relative to its normal place
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Glued to the container: Absolute Positioning</p>
          Aligning it exactly where you want it within its parent container
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fixed on the screen: Fixed Positioning</p>
          Setting an element in a fixed place on the viewport/screen
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="def relativePos">
      <h2>position: relative;</h2>
      <p>
        An element with <span id="highlight">position: relative;</span> is set
        in relation to its own default position, and that of its parent
        container within the webpage flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means we created a section (parent container) and inside this we
        created an item. This item (element) , like text or an image, is set to
        behave and adjust itself, in relation to itself, and to the section it
        belongs to.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let’s say we have a section on the web page called
        <span id="highlight">‘.homeContent’</span> Inside this section, you have
        two smaller areas, one for links, and one for an image. Both are set to
        <span id="highlight">‘position: relative’</span>. This means they will
        stay in their usual place but can be shifted slightly without disturbing
        the overall flow and layout. It also means the elements will adjust
        alongside the parent container as it adjusts to different screen types
        and platforms.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="def absolutePos">
      <h2>position: absolute;</h2>
      <p>
        An element with <span id="highlight">position: absolute;</span>, sits in
        relation to its parent container, exactly where you want it to. Think
        back to the metaphor of the tree. The webpage is the trunk, with
        containers and elements being branches and leaves. Absolute positioning
        allows you to glue a leaf exactly where you want to on a branch
        (parent), regardless of how the branch moves. This means we can place
        elements exactly where we like them in a section, and keep them there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s use Tooltips as an example. Say you are writing a blog post and
        you want a Tooltip to appear when a certain word is hovered over. You
        can use absolute positioning to make sure the tooltip hovers over the
        correct word, regardless of how the page content shifts. You could
        create a container called <span id="highlight">.toolTip</span> and set
        it to <span id="highlight">position: relative;</span>. Inside this, you
        have a child element called
        <span id="highlight">.toolTipText</span> with
        <span id="highlight">position: absolute;</span>. This setup ensures that
        the tooltip text always appears in the right spot relative to the word
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="def fixedPos">
      <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
      <p>
        An element with <span id="highlight">position: fixed;</span> will stay
        anchored in place on the viewport (the screen), regardless of where you
        scroll. This is useful for things that you want to remain visible at all
        times on the screen. It is like super gluing a picture of your cat on
        top of your screen, so you can always see its lovely little face.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can often see this used for navigation and branding purposes. They
        can help users move through the page and links, remember where they are,
        and return to where they want to go. These are access and orientation
        prompts that help users interact effectively with the webpage.
