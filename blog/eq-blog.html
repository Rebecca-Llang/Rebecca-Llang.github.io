        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the active practice and understanding
          of emotions and perspectives. This involves not only understanding our
          own emotions and behaviours but also recognizing and empathising with
          the feelings and viewpoints of others. EQ is about identifying and
          processing our own emotions, while also being attuned to the emotions
          and perspectives of those around us. Applying compassion,
          communicating clearly, and holding oneself accountable—without
          becoming defensive—are all key components of emotional intelligence.
          These skills are cultivated and honed through continuous practice,
          both within ourselves and in our interactions with others.

    <h2>EQ & IQ</h2>
    <div class="block1">
      <div class="block1bebes">
        <p>
          EQ differs from IQ in its focus and skillset. IQ is traditionally
          associated with memory, logic, reasoning, and the application of
          knowledge in areas like the sciences. It is often seen as a measure of
          cognitive processing and performance.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          However, this view can be limiting, as it tends to overlook other
          forms of intelligence that are equally important. By focusing solely
          on IQ, we may undervalue the contributions and insights that come from
          emotional and social intelligence. Each person brings unique
          experiences and skills to the table, offering diverse perspectives and
          valuable insights.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block1bebes">
        <p>
          When we create environments that prioritise emotional intelligence, we
          enable individuals and groups to flourish. Understanding yourself and
          how you engage with both your inner world and those around you is
          crucial for effective teamwork and personal fulfilment.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          Developing the ability to self-regulate in a healthy manner, managing
          emotions without suppressing them, and genuinely connecting with
          others brings about sustainable and meaningful personal growth.

          Mindfulness is the practice of being aware of and attentive to the
          present moment, observing stimuli, emotions, and thoughts without
          judgement. Self-awareness, a big part of EQ, involves being mindful of
          oneself. We do this by acknowledging and understanding our own
          emotions, and discerning which ones require action or deeper
          reflection.

          Boundaries are also integral to emotional intelligence. While often
          viewed as measures to control others behaviour, boundaries are about
          staying true to oneself and taking personal action. When boundaries
          are crossed, the key is how you respond, as we can only control our
          own actions. Recognizing the limits of our control allows us to focus
          on what we can manage, leading to more effective and peaceful
          decision-making. Practising emotional intelligence can positively
          influence both the self and the group, lifting everyone together.

        <p>
          I really enjoyed learning about the Fogg Behavior Model. It offers a
          practical approach to creating long-term habits by breaking down the
          psychological steps involved. It emphasises targeting specific
          behaviours, attaching them to existing habits, and keeping them
          simple. According to Fogg, behaviours are driven by a combination of
          motivation, ability, and a trigger. No behaviour occurs without a
          prompt, and using existing behaviours as triggers can be highly
          effective. For example, you might say, “After I do [existing
          behaviour], I will do [new behaviour].” Celebrating these small
          successes helps reinforce the behaviour, making it more likely to
          continue.

          There are two habits that I am committing to to help me during this
          time. One is for confidence and technical skill building, and the
          other for clarity and mindfulness.

          Firstly, I want to improve my note revision process. I often find
          myself overwhelmed when working on my blogs. To address this, I plan
          to review my notes each morning before starting my work. I have a
          well-established routine of coffee and news. I will replace my
          news-reading time with note revision to better internalise the
          material and have it fresh when working on my content. I want to draw
          insights and solutions to struggles I’m having, along with building
          confidence with the content.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block2bebes">
        <p>
          Secondly, I want to incorporate a 5-10 minute morning meditation or
          yoga session into my routine. This will help me start my day in a
          calmer, more centred state, and connect me to my physical needs.
          Often, when I am deeply focused, I neglect my body's signals for
          hunger and movement. Integrating this practice after making breakfast
          and before eating (or while it cooks) will help me stay attuned to my
          physical self.

          Bodyscanning is a technique I use to help me with this, and is a habit
          I try to stick to, and take action on. Before beginning any task, I
          check in with myself to ensure I have eaten, hydrated, and moved my
          body. Reconnecting with my physical self helps me step out of my head
          and into the present world, signalling to myself that I am safe and my
          basic needs are met. This grounding process calms me and enables me to
          make better choices, as I know I am looking after myself.
