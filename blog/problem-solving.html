        <h2>Blocked</h2>
        <p>
          I was having many issues with the kata challenge. I tried rereading
          notes, googling, talking to peers and my partner. I kept trying
          things, and using comments to try to break down the problem, and keep
          note of what I’d tried, and was really struggling to understand both
          the question and where I was going wrong. I was feeling stressed,
          confused and started to really question if I could handle this much
          stress and panic against time. After a big journey (refer to the being
          reluctant to ask for help paragraph), the solutions were all rather
          simple. If I had asked for help significantly earlier, and had
          followed the curriculum and tests, rather than getting confused with
          the file layouts, and digging deeper and deeper holes, I would have
          been able to navigate that experience significantly better. The
          biggest thing I learnt was how my mindset, and refusal to let myself
          truly rest when I needed it, was preventing me from being able to work
          through the problem. It was wonderful that my panic posts were able to
          help others, and I’m super keen to learn from this experience, and ask
          for help significantly earlier, while also making sure I'm looking
          after myself.

        <h2>Solved</h2>
        <p>
          I was struggling on one of the katas, had read and googled, discussed
          with a peer, and looked at lots of others' code around the problem. I
          was feeling a bit overwhelmed, however, after seeing how many
          different answers there could be, I felt more comfortable knowing
          there isn’t just one right answer. Watching the livestreams I could
          see that it was ok that I'm struggling and trying to code things out
          fully to help my understanding. The main lesson was that there can be
          a lot of different answers, and it’s about trying and learning, as in
          trusting the process, and having patience for where I am at.

        <p style="color: #003c3a">
          Pseudocode - love, here for it, once i’ve properly understood what the
          question is asking me, and am clear with my comments.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Trying something - I am comfortable at the start, and then I start to panic if i can’t read my comments or feel like I’m attempting the same thing repeatedly. I feel like at this stage, i’m often trying too many things at once, and getting lost in that.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Rubber ducky method - I talk out loud, and to my partner (who sometimes clickity clacks next to me), and I think about bringing in something like the rubber ducky for when that option is not available. I’ll try with a plushie cat we have (Tova, she’s cute).</p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Reading error messages - getting better, but often leads me lost. I enjoy watching them be read in the livestreams and when i’m getting shared screen support. This is something I’m really keen to be more comfortable with. </p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Console.logging - yes and no, i get a bit lost when to use it/why it doesn’t work sometimes. It might have something to do with me getting lost within my apps/the terminal itself</p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Googling - pretty confident, I think I go too deep in the research stage, and the time would be better spent bringing in the practice earlier, as I will always end up looking up or exploring more things as I problem solve anyway.</p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Asking your peers for help - Once I feel like I’ve made a connection with someone (usually 1 or 2 interactions) then I feel mostly comfortable enough. I’ve been communicating with someone in the cohort quite regularly, for chats and helping each other. I have reached out to a few others for various reasons. I do like meeting new people and making friends, and it’s nice being able to help each other when we can.</p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Asking coaches for help - usually yes, but I think I might feel some stubbornness when trying to figure it out myself first, which can last too long when I’m stuck. It stops me from moving forward, and the facilitators are so incredibly helpful and lovely to engage with.  I tend to post in the main discord when I feel it would be more appropriate than reaching out directly to them. 
        </p>
        <p style="color: #003c3a">Improving your process with reflection - I’ve been thinking a lot, and talking to my partner, friends and a peer in the cohort. I’m looking forward to putting those reflections into practice more effectively. </p>

<!-- relfection on reluctancy-->
    <div class="introContainer">
      <div class="intro">
        <h2>Reluctancy</h2>
          <p>I had many times that I was stuck and stressed, and didn’t ask for help. My reluctancy came from feeling emotionally dysregulated, time-stressed and feeling like I couldn’t articulate the question of what I needed help with. The reason for this was that I had feeling stuck over and over for so long, and the things I tried and my usual techniques of notes, googling (w3schools, mdn, medium.com & geeksforgeeks.org), spoken to a peer, tried to talk it through with my partner (which was hard as I started crying about it), and then panic posted in the discord. 
          </p>
          <p>A facilitator replied which helped me later, and someone else who had the same problem. I also dm’d to share the overall problem,  which was me freaking out that I felt so uncomfortable and lost with it all. Reassurance that everything was ok, I was learning these things can be tough, and everyone is here to help and work together. This and a very correct call that I needed to take a break and rest was what I needed. </p>
          <p>This was so true. I was exhausted, and not looking after my wellbeing. So I took that time. I checked in with my facilitator and rested my tired little brain. I spent time with mi amor. I walked to my studio, watched the birds in the trees, and took the time to rest and reflect on my own. Once I felt like the deep well of sadness, and struggle, had lifted I was able to check a few things to see what I had missed in my distress. Now calm and with a clear head, I had a great sleep and absolutely smashed the answer when I came back to it early the next morning.
