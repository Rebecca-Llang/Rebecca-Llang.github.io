          <h2 style="font-size: 1em">The benefits of neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity instructs people how to rewire the brain, build habits and long term memory. It explains how the brain processes information and forms, secures and prunes connections. With consistent practice, it can help people train their brains to better support them, and their goals.

        <div class="intro">
          <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Personal engagement with neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>Daily practice, reflection and conscious attunement for long term memory and holistic understandings of information and skills. </p>
          <p>I think my biggest challenge is having patience when I’m working through content and problems. Actively telling myself to slow down and break the problem down, can help me not catastrophise. Slowly chipping away at the problem, and reaching out for help when I need it, will build confidence in my ability. 
          </p>
          <p>Reflecting on what I’ve learnt, and writing it down clearly with what the key points are, is going to help me see when I am going too fast. I've noticed a tendancy to think, ah that's simple, I don't need to write it down. However this is tripping me up as I progress. Being more specific, and clear, when writing, reflecting and revising my notes, will help solidify the concepts. Remembering to have compassion and patience with myself, especially when I feel overwhelmed, will allow me to be in a space to learn and grow. </p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Ways to increase neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>Practice skills, place skills in context, reflect on learning, self-appreciation/validation, repeat. </p>
        <p>The more you practice, absorb, define and reflect, the stronger the neural connections will be.</p>  
        <p> Display/practice ability, to build confidence. Self-reflect as well as sharing/teaching with peers to expand and reaffirm.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Quality Reflections</h2>
          <p>I found the paper on <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/learning-by-thinking-how-reflection-improves-performance"></a>how reflections improves performance really helpful. It has helped me recognise the quality of my reflections can be deeply enhanced. Think, say out loud, preferably to a person, and write it down. Going through each step intentionally. The paper shows speaking it out loud helps significantly as one is starting to learn, and trying to grasp the basics.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Growth Vs Fixed Mindset</h2>
            <p>Growth Mindset, in opposition to fixed mindset, is the thought that what is not known, or not refined, leaves spaces to learn and grow. Where as a fixed mindset focuses on a personal or permanent failure that can not be expanded on. Having a growth mindset focuses on space to learn, grow and improve rather than being unable, or less than, for not “achieving”. The focus on the future and more space to learn encourages compassion for the self, empowers and allows for individual and peer learning and support.

              <div class="intro">
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Thoughts:</h2> 
              <p>It is wonderful to think that is becoming a norm in education, especially considering my experiences being undiagnosed with ADHD, and issues with focus and stimulation, throughout my education journey. 
              </p>
              <p>In my research on ADHD, and time in therapy, I spent time looking at neuroplasicity, self-talk and self-compassion and it has had a huge impact on the way I manage myself and exist in my daily life. Self-compassion has been the biggest mindset change, and is an integral part of shifting from a fixed mindset, to a growth one. </p>
         <p>I still struggle with this, and didn’t realise how much I struggle maintaining this when I feel time-pressure. My personal expectations of myself, and identifying why I think the way I do about things when I’m under pressure, shows the space I have to go in truly internalising this.

              <h2 style="font-size: 1em;">Application for Self:</h2>
              <p>Congratulate myself on my personal achievements and growth, no matter how small they seem. </p>
            <p>Embrace challenge and expectations with compassion, with a focus on learning and sharing, rather than binary thinking of success/failure.</p>
            <p>Self-awareness of my confidence/catastrophsing, ie Dunning-Kruger effect (the more you know, the less you know as the world is so complex).</p>
              <p>Gratitude and appreciation. Track my progress.
