          <h2 style="font-size: 1em">The benefits of neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity instructs people how to rewire the brain, build habits and long term memory. It explains how the brain processes information and forms, secures and prunes connections. With consistent practice, it can help people train their brains to better support them, and their goals.

        <div class="intro">
          <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Personal engagement with neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>Daily practice, reflection and conscious attunement for long term memory and holistic understandings of information and skills. </p>
          <p>I think my biggest challenge is having patience when I’m working through content and problems. Actively telling myself to slow down and break the problem down, can help me not catastrophise. Slowly chipping away at the problem, and reaching out for help when I need it, will build confidence in my ability. 
          </p>
          <p>Reflecting on what I’ve learnt, and writing it down clearly with what the key points are, is going to help me see when I am going too fast. I've noticed a tendancy to think, ah that's simple, I don't need to write it down. However this is tripping me up as I progress. Being more specific, and clear, when writing, reflecting and revising my notes, will help solidify the concepts. Remembering to have compassion and patience with myself, especially when I feel overwhelmed, will allow me to be in a space to learn and grow. </p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Ways to increase neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>Practice skills, place skills in context, reflect on learning, self-appreciation/validation, repeat. </p>
        <p>The more you practice, absorb, define and reflect, the stronger the neural connections will be.</p>  
        <p> Display/practice ability, to build confidence. Self-reflect as well as sharing/teaching with peers to expand and reaffirm.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1em">Quality Reflections</h2>
          <p>I found the paper on <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/learning-by-thinking-how-reflection-improves-performance"></a>how reflections improves performance really helpful. It has helped me recognise the quality of my reflections can be deeply enhanced. Think, say out loud, preferably to a person, and write it down. Going through each step intentionally.</p>
